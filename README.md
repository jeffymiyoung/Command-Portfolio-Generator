* Open to the specific Directory you have placed this Repo
* Open a new Terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory (otherwise Node will not work)
* Install the proper Node Files that are necessary for the application to run `node install`
* Once node is properly updated for the Repo ~ Run command `node app`
* This will prompt you to answer multiple questions for your personal section, and multiple inputs for your work section - Answer how you see fit
* After you have added all of your project to your work section by filling out the prompted questions, the File and Stylesheet will be created and copied accordingly
* Check the `dist` folder for the output `index.html` and enjoy your new portfolio!
